                <li>6 slices of bacon, diced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>4 cups of chicken broth</li>
                <li>5 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of sour cream</li>
                <li>1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in the pot. Add onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in chicken broth and cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in potatoes.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in heavy cream and sour cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                <li>If the soup is too thick, add more chicken broth as needed until desired consistency is reached.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with bacon, cheese, and green onions, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
